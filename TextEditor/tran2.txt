<lop1>[Conditional statement. If condition is true, code block will execute .]
<lop2>[Counterpart to lop1. If lop1 condition is not true, lop2 block will be executed.]
<lop3>[Conditional block following lop1. If lop1 statement is not true, evaluates new(lop3) statement. If statement is true, block executes and no more conditionals in the train are executed. If not, program moves past block.]
<lop4>[Compares left and right hand objects/basic types. If left is greater than right, returns true. If right is greater than left, returns false.]
<lop5>[Compares left and right hand objects/basic types. If left is smaller than right, returns true. If right is smaller than left, returns false.]
<lop6>[Compares left and right hand objects/basic types. If left is equivalent to right, returns true. If right is equivalent to left, returns true. If objects/values are unequal, returns false.]
<lop7>[Compares left and right hand objects/basic types. If left is not equivalent to right, returns true. If right is not equivalent to left, returns true. If objects/values are equal, returns false.]
<lop8>[Continually operates a a block as long as condition is true.]
<lop9>[Determines whether a value is in a dataset.]
<lop10>[Indicates whether or not a value has a certain type.]
<obj1>[Type, capable of holding either true or false value.]
<obj2>[Type capable of holding individual characters.]
<obj3>[Type capable of holding basic integer values.(Generally 32 bits, occassionally 16).]
<obj4>[Type capable of holding basic floating point values.]
<obj5>[Type capable of holding other types.]
<syn1>[Ends a statement.(; in most languages).]
<syn2>[Indicates the beginning of a prioritized statement.]
<syn3>[Indicates the end of a prioritized statement.]
<syn4>[Indicates the beginning of a block of statements.]
<syn5>[Indicates the end of a block of statements.]
<syn6>[Indicates the beginning of a private block of statements.]
<syn7>[Indicates the end of a private block of statements.]
<syn8>[Indicates the beginning of a protected block of statements.]
<syn9>[Indicates the end of a protected block of statements.]
<syn10>[Indicates the beginning of a public block of statements.]
<syn11>[Indicates the end of a public block of statements.]
<syn12>[Defines an exit point for a loop.]
<syn13>[Ends the current iteration of the loop without ending the whole loop.]
<syn14>[Placeholder, program passes over execution of this statement.]
<mem1>[Allocates something to program memory.]
<mem2>[Deallocates something from program memory.]
<mem3>[Location of an item in memory.]
<mem4>[Indicates a variable whose value cannot be changed.]
<mem5>[Indicates the return value of a function.]
<mem6>[Indicates the special return value of a function.]
<mem7>[Defines a dataset of multiple values.]
<exc1>[Indicates a block for which exceptions may be activated.]
<exc2>[Indicates a block in which exceptions may be handled.]
<exc3>[Triggers an exception.]
<exc4>[Indicates a block that will be handle exceptions assuming every other exception handling block failed.]
